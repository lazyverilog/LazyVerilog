# lazyverilog

## Purpose
SystemVerilog LSP server written in C++. Provides language intelligence (formatting, linting, go-to-definition, references, auto-wire, auto-instantiation, etc.) for SystemVerilog/Verilog files via the Language Server Protocol.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CMakeLists.txt` | CMake build configuration |
| `lazyverilog.toml` | LSP server config — formatting and linting options |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project instructions for AI agents |
| `README.md` | Project overview and usage |
| `.gitmodules` | Git submodule configuration |

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `src/` | C++ source — server core + all LSP feature implementations (see `src/AGENTS.md`) |
| `tests/` | Unit and integration tests (see `tests/AGENTS.md`) |
| `docs/` | Documentation for formatter options and diagnostics (see `docs/AGENTS.md`) |
| `tools/` | Dev/benchmark utilities (see `tools/AGENTS.md`) |
| `lua/` | Neovim plugin Lua integration (see `lua/AGENTS.md`) |

## For AI Agents

### Build
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### Testing Requirements
```bash
ctest --test-dir build                          # all tests
./build/lazyverilog-tests "[tag]"               # single feature
./build/lazyverilog-tests "test name here"      # single named test
```

### Working In This Directory
- Core formatting logic: `src/features/formatter.cpp` → `format_source()`
- Config options documented: `docs/formatter/options.md`
- Each LSP feature lives in its own `src/features/*.cpp` file
- Tests mirror feature files: `tests/test_formatter.cpp` tests `src/features/formatter.cpp`

### Common Patterns
- Token-based, idempotent formatting via sequential passes
- Config loaded from `lazyverilog.toml`, walked up from the opened file's directory
- JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout

### AST / Index Architecture Philosophy
- Current/open buffers are represented by live slang `SyntaxTree` AST snapshots.
  This keeps cursor-sensitive features precise for unsaved edits, diagnostics,
  local syntax context, and operations that need exact source structure.
- Other files should generally be represented by compact `SyntaxIndex` shards,
  not by retained full ASTs.  Project/filelist files may number in the hundreds
  or thousands, so keeping full ASTs for every file would increase memory use,
  allocator/source-manager lifetime complexity, and request-path contention.
- In short:
  - current file: AST is authoritative;
  - other/project/closed files: index is authoritative;
  - avoid designing features that require closed project files to keep ASTs.
- If a current/open file needs index-shaped facts such as modules, instances,
  symbol IDs, or reference occurrences, derive those facts from the current
  file AST.  Prefer caching such AST-derived indexes per immutable
  `DocumentState` snapshot when they are reused across requests; invalidate by
  replacing the `DocumentState` on `didChange`.
- Do not move expensive whole-project merges or closed-file AST walks onto hot
  request paths.  Background indexing should publish reusable index snapshots,
  and request handlers should consume those snapshots without reparsing or
  rebuilding project-wide state.

### Formatter Pass Ownership and Idempotency
- Formatter flow is: lexer lexes source into Tokenflow, then `SyntaxPass`,
  `MacroPass`, `WrapPass`, `IndentPass`, `AlignPass`, `CommentPass`,
  `SpacingPass`, `BlankLinePass`, then rendering.
- Token data is split into immutable facts and mutable formatting metadata.
- Each pass has exclusive write ownership of its metadata family:
  - `TokenCollector` (lexer) writes `LexemeFacts` and `InputTriviaFacts`
  - `SyntaxPass` writes `SyntaxFacts`, `TopologyFacts`, and `CommentFacts`
  - `MacroPass` writes `MacroMetadata`
  - `WrapPass` writes `WrapMetadata`
  - `IndentPass` writes `IndentMetadata`
  - `AlignPass` writes `AlignMetadata`
  - `CommentPass` writes `CommentMetadata`
  - `SpacingPass` writes `SpaceMetadata`
  - `BlankLinePass` writes `BlankLineMetadata`
- Prevent non-idempotency:
  - Prefer `slang::parsing::TokenKind` facts from the lexer.
  - Do not use regex, string search, or string comparison for syntax decisions
    when a `TokenKind`-based check is available.
  - Do not write formatter pass logic that depends on how the original source
    looked. Referencing `input_trivia` inside a pass is not desired because it
    can make formatting depend on pre-format whitespace.
  - Exception: comment role classification may reference original source
    positioning. This is unavoidable for distinguishing own-line comments from
    trailing comments, and must be handled carefully so it does not create
    non-idempotent formatting behavior.
